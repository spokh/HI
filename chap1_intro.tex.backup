\chapter{INTRODUCTION} \label{chap:1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Every part of the world is competing for the exploitation of currently 
available energy resources, mainly fossil fuels like coal, petroleum oils and gases for their daily needs and development activities ~\cite{Chong2016, Makogon2007}. The fossil fuels, so called  conventional sources of energy, however, are going to be over in near future\ ~\cite{Makogon2007}. Also it has been understood that the excessive emission of carbon and other green house gases on the cost of exploitation of fossil fuels for luxury and material development has adversely affected the environment~\cite{Eslamimanesh2012}. Green house gases are supposed to be the main cause of {\it global warming} (the continuous increases in temperature of the earth) which has endangered natural creation and human life. In this context, the search of environment friendly, or less pollutant sources of energy is more than compulsory. Methane in natural gas-resources like clathrate hydrates has been considered widely available unconventional source of energy, if their extraction becomes technically and economically viable~\cite{Editorial07}. Methane clathrate structures are ice like solids which enclose the methane molecules inside them. Even though extraction of methane from its natural resources is one of the major challenges, its extraction, effective storage and transportation as an energy fuel is another hurdle for practical applications like vehicular transportation.
Absorptive storage in light materials like porous carbon materials are supposed to be one of the options for such purpose ~\cite{Menon1998, Wood2012}. On the other hand, methane is the simplest alkane molecule and can be a model structure to understand the process in protein folding and its denaturation ~\cite{Hummer1998}. In this context, understanding methane in different environments like, methane hydrates, porous carbon materials and liquid media, is the first step for methane related multidimensional practical applications. In the present work, we will introduce methane-methane and methane-host interactions in clathrates, functionalized graphene and solvent environments.

\section{Methane hydrates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{sloppypar}
The natural reserve of methane occurs within the clathrate structure of methane hydrates (CH$_4$-H$_2$O). As we discussed before, methane hydrates,
including other gas hydrates, are mainly ice like cages (however different from the ordinary ices structures), where the gaseous molecules are encapsulated and compressed within the cages~\cite{Sloan2008, Tulk2012}. The cage structure is stable due to two factors (i) hydrophobic (repulsive) interaction in between the host (water cages) and guest (methane) molecules, and (ii) an attractive interaction in between water molecules in the cages~\cite{Sloan1998}. These ice-like hydrates burn in contact with fire, upon release of methane, and are known as {\it fiery ice} meant for {\it burning ice} [Figure \ref{burning_ice}]. The empty cages are also unstable and get collapsed due to lack in balance of forces~\cite{Belosludov2002}. Since the methane hydrates are stable only within the limited region of P-T diagram, mainly at high pressure and low temperature, they are unstable either on lowering the pressure or increasing the temperature~\cite{Eslamimanesh2012}.

\begin{sloppypar}
The first discovery of gas hydrate clathrates starts 200 hundred years ago \cite{Davy1811, Loveday2008}. Many small non-polar small gas molecules like H$_2$, CO$_2$, NH$_3$, CH$_4$ and some large polar molecules (tetrahydrafuran) have been investigated as the guest molecules in clathrate hydrates \cite{Sloan1998, Loveday2008}. The natural occurrence of gas hydrates is available at the particular conditions of temperature and pressure \cite{Jeffery1984a, Petrenko1999}, and methane hydrates in particular are found at the moderate compression and low temperature (300 bar at 22 $^\circ$C, and 50 bar at 4 $^\circ$C, the latter being typical conditions in the ocean floor)~\cite{Sloan2008} as shown in Figure~\ref{location}. The dissociation/decomposition of the gas hydrates release the gaseous molecules and water, and do not make chemical bonding in between them. Since methane gas causes a heavy green house effect, dozens of times more than CO$_2$ ~\cite{IPCC2007}, its unwanted release from the natural resources promotes cyclic effect of global warming ~\cite{Dickens1995}. Atomistic level of understanding of the physical, thermodynamic and structural properties of multiple hydrates helps to know the undergoing phenomena at different environmental conditions, and carries multi-dimensional applications like clearance of pipeline blockage~\cite{Sloan2008, Sloan2003}, understanding global warming phenomenon in academia~\cite{Dickens1995}, enhancing academic thought 
for clathrate solids \cite{Loveday2008}, stability of sea floor \cite{Kvenvolden1993} and potential of unconventional source of energy~\cite{Kvenvolden1988, Chong2016}. The basic understanding of methane hydrate is also important for the separation~\cite{Kang2000}, storage and transportation of energy carrying gases \cite{Yevi1996, Eslamimanesh2012}. 
\end{sloppypar}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{Chapter1/methane_hydrate.eps}
\caption[Worldwide locations of gas hydrate.]{Worldwide locations of gas hydrate. Continental margins and permafrost regions are the rich area for gas hydrate \cite{Advisory_2002}.}
\label{location}
\end{figure}
Since the methane hydrate is one of the major components of the interior of the outer planets and their moons like Uranus, Neptune, and Titan, its relevancy extends to the planetary science, and also to the outer Solar system, where they are supposed to be composed of methane-water mixture \cite{Alibert2006, Machida06}. On the earth, it is available at the conditions of permafrost regions in between 200-700 m and on the ocean floor in between 2000-4000 m as shown in Figure \ref{location} ~\cite{Sloan1998}. The location and the thickness of the hydrate slab are affected by the temperature, pressure, availability of methane gas itself, and other geological factors. The source of natural methane is supposed to be either from the biological activities at the level of ocean sediments or geological phenomenon in the deep of the earth \cite{Advisory_2002}.
 
\begin{sloppypar}
It is believed that carbon in methane hydrates is more than twice of the carbon available in currently exploited fossil fuel: conventional gas,
oil and coal combined (\cite{Booth1996, Shu-Mao2011}). The United States, department of energy (DOE), has predicted a huge storage of natural methane in hydrates, and has reported that its partial extraction can fulfill the total national demand of energy for more than eight decades \cite{Editorial07}. Since methane emits less carbon on burning comparing to larger hydrocarbon systems, it is supposed to be cleaner source of energy. In addition to the abundant source of methane, methane-rich compounds are widely distributed in all around the world [Figure \ref{location}]. This diversity in distribution is favorable to access methane hydrates at wider parts of the world and encourage more and more authorities to be involved in methane extraction process. Some of the countries like Japan and South Korea, whose increasing national demand of energy are being fulfilled with exporting their huge economy, have prioritized gas hydrate related research and industrial activities~~\cite{Makogon2007}.
\end{sloppypar} 

\begin{sloppypar}
Methane hydrates (MH) are also found to be present on man made pipelines carrying petroleum gas and oil, particularly to those which pass though the cold temperatures \cite{Sloan1998}. The formation of solid hydrates in pipelines is concerned to the flow (blockage of the pipeline) and safety issues of transportation of petroleum products. The knowledge of environmental conditions and inhibitors for the formation and decomposition of methane hydrates may help to get assurance of pipeline flow. Gas hydrates, on the other hand, can be the useful media for industrial sectors if they are used in proper way. They are applicable for the segregation, sequestration and storage of useful (like CH$_4$) and unwanted (like CO$_2$) gas molecules~\cite{Chatti2005} which help to reduce the green house gases in the environment~\cite{Rackley2010, Hester2010}. The knowledge of in/stability of gas hydrates is the fundamental requirement for the segregation of energy carrying gases like methane in natural hydrate stores \cite{Makal2012}. Since methane is compressed in hydrate structure, the volume of methane is 160 times the volume of ice at normal temperature and pressure \cite{Editorial07}, gas hydrates are the obvious choice for the effective storage and transportation of methane like gases~\cite{Ganji2007, Thomas2003}. The effects of surfactants and alternative techniques to study the hydrate formation kinetics are also the subject of interest~\cite{Daimaru2007, Rogers2007}.
\end{sloppypar}

As we discussed in last paragraphs, the relevancy of gas hydrates in energy and industrial sectors is highly dependent on its structural stability.
Figure~\ref{location} shows the the stability zone of methane hydrates, and reveals that its clathrate structures are usually stable at the conditions of natural occupancy of hydrates, low temperature and high pressure~\cite{Sloan2008}. The clathrates at high pressure have thus attracted a large number of research activities from the academicians and industrial sectors to understand the formation, dissociation and changes in
structural properties of gas hydrates \cite{Loveday01-rev, Hirai04}. They have reported some controversial results regarding its stability ~\cite{Loveday2008} and dissociation ~\cite{Shu-Mao2011} into its constituents during the elevated pressure. MH-III structure, also known as the filled-ice structure (FIIhS), is the highest pressure structure known till date ~\cite{Machida06}. It is supposed to be consistent to the interior of some of the icy planets and has been the subject of great interest for further study. Experiments have their limitations due to huge expenses, and unaccessible (extreme pressure and temperature) laboratory requirements. The computational facilities on the other hand, are being developed historically in the fastest rate which make larger systems accessible ~\cite{ICTP2012, Pakin2013} for simulations in extreme conditions.

Since methane is the major component of conventional energy resources and natural gas hydrates, its dominance in energy related territories in present and near future is understandable. Its extraction (from the natural stores), effective storage and transportation for practical applications are prime issues of methane related research and technology. The carbon nanomaterials with the selected functional groups as porous media are considered as potential candidates for light, safe and economic storage of natural gases.

\section{Methane on Functionalized graphene}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{sloppypar}
Adsorption properties of methane on two dimensional materials, including carbon nano compounds, are discussed under this section. We introduce the changes in properties of monolayer graphene as two dimensional material upon adsorption of impurity atoms (metal atoms) which are important to increase the reactivity of the substrates. Since graphene has light mass and high surface to volume ratio, increase in reactivity of such materials have additional advantage to store non-polar gases like methane with the desired range of binding strength ~\cite{Carrillo2009}. We will introduce implications of change in geometric, electronic and magnetic properties of such materials upon adsorption of single metal atoms and small gaseous molecules like molecular methane and hydrogen.
\end{sloppypar}

Carbon combine to itself in varied ways and different hybridizaions to form many allotropes. They can be listed as nanotubes, nanoribbons, nanohorns, fullerenes and other newly developed carbon nano-families [Figure~\ref{Graphene_allo}]. Among the allotropes, diamond and graphite with sp$^3$ hybridization, are 3-dimensional materials~\cite{Geim2007}. Carbon nanotube, on the other hand, is 1-dimensional material because of its (long) length comparing to other dimensionalities~\cite{Li2008}. Fullerene is 0-dimentional material whose structure look like a football and is made up of 60 carbon atoms (C60) with 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons ~\cite{Kroto2010}.

\begin{sloppypar}
Graphene, an atom thick two dimensional honeycomb lattice, has a series of special electronic and physical properties. In addition, as a carbon material it is cheap, widely distributed and abundant in nature. Its exceptional physical strength, large surface area, high electrical and thermal conductivities, low noise effect and many more other interesting properties explore multiple possible applications~\cite{Novoselov2005, Schedin2007}. Graphene with its high sensitivity towards external charge, magnetic field and mechanical strain, has controllably tunable band structure which deserves its application towards industrial sectors like electronics~\cite{Han-2013}, spintronics~\cite{hu-2014} and chemical and gas sensors~\cite{Basu2012}.
\end{sloppypar}

\begin{sloppypar}
\noindent Because of tunable graphene bands and well-developed experimental techniques at nano level, doped graphene including other carbon nanomaterials  are becoming interesting areas for material scientists~\cite{Chan2008}. Alkali-metal-doped carbon materials to fabricate 
the electronic devices \cite{Radosavljevic2004}, and heavily doped Ti-adatom-graphene to adsorb CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ \cite{Carrillo2009} have been tested with useful results. The adsorption of gaseous particles like molecular hydrogens in modified graphene with vacancies~\cite{Fair2013}, and adatoms ~\cite{Pantha2015-nano} have also been studied for the purpose of storage and transportation of energy carrying gases. The results remark that modified graphene are superior over pure graphene for the adsorption of non-polar molecules (say molecular hydrogen) at operating temperature. Graphene has also been studied as a component of bilayer material (graphene-MoS$_2$ 
bilayer for an example) for the adsorption of molecular gases~\cite{Lamichhane2016}. The comparison of adsorption properties of molecular hydrogen and helogens on bilayer structure show that two sides of heterostructure behave differently towards the gaseous molecules~\cite{Paudyal2016}.

As discussed in previous paragraphs, methane is one of the widely used natural sources of energy. Besides its dominant presence in nature, methane is superior over conventional petroleum oil and fossil fuels mainly due to two main reasons. First; methane carries more energy due to its higher hydrogen to carbon ratio and the second; it is more environment friendly as
methane emits less carbon on burning \cite{NETL2010, Ma2010}. However, the traditional methods of its storage and transportation, the compressed natural gases (CNG) and liquefied natural gases (LNG), are always the subject of debate due to space, weight and safety related issues especially for vehicular (fuel) applications at operating conditions~\cite{MASON2015, CASCO2015}. Adsorption of methane in suitable substrates like two dimensional light materials such as modified (by functional groups) graphitic materials with right order of binding has been considered as one of the options for reversible storage~\cite{Wood2012, Kandagal2012}. Modification of pure graphitic substrates with metal atoms also improves the reactivity of such materials and increases the binding strength towards the nonpolar adsorbates \cite{Lamichhane2014}. A wide range of transition metal atoms in graphene and nanotube surfaces have shown that most of the metal adatoms are useful for improving the binding strength towards molecular hydrogens \cite{Valencia2015, Pantha2015-ijmb}. Note that reversible storage of energy carrying gases requires moderate range of adsorption energy (eg. in the order of 0.2~eV for hydrogen and methane), where very high adsorption energy requires extra energy to release and very small adsorption energy does not hold the gases at higher (room) temperature~\cite{Bhatia2006}. Because of their incomplete inner shells, transition metal atoms have tunable properties during their interaction with other materials and considered them
in metal clusters for metal organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are being designed as porous materials to store energy carrying gases~\cite{Shengqian2008}.
\end{sloppypar}

Adsorption of methane by graphene-oxide systems have been recently studied by Chouhan et al. \cite{Chouhan2015}. The authors have noticed significant increment of adsorption energy (up to 50 \% ) due to modification with oxides where the vdW interactions are shown to be crucial. We incorporate London dispersion forces as vdW interactions to study the effects of transition metal adatoms from 3d series (Sc to Zn) on graphene for binding of molecular methane(s).

\section{Methane-dimer in solvent environment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{sloppypar}
Hydrophobicity of non-polar molecules in water is characterized by low solubility of solutes and strong like-molecular attractive interactions \cite{Sharp1991, Scherga1998}. It can also be defined by the aggregating property of hydrocarbons in water/aqueous-solutions where the water molecules are excluded by the hydrophobes~\cite{IUPAC1997}. Hydrophobicity mainly includes two aspects of the interactions; (i) the effect of solute particles on surrounding solvent molecules, defined by hydrophobic hydration, and (ii) the tendency of solute particles to aggregate, defined by hydrophobic interaction \cite{Raschke2001}. Because of hydrophobic hydration, water molecules make a spherical shell around the nonpolar solutes (methane for an example). On the other hand, solute particles and nonpolar residues in proteins are aggregated to expose less surface area to water, which is related to hydrophilic interaction. Solvent perturbation in solute-solute (hydrophobic) interaction is one of the model systems of biological processes in protein- (or/and protein like molecules) structure, folding, functions and denaturation \cite{Gekko1998, Hwang2011}. It has also been observed that the strength and magnitude of hydrophobic properties are affected by the size and nature of the solute particles, and also the temperature and pressure of the solvent environment \cite{Makowski2010}.
\end{sloppypar}
 
Hydrocarbons are the major components of biological molecules (including proteins) and are widely considered to study hydrophobic processes. Proteins are made up of a long chain of amino acids and with side-chain residues in different arrangements~\cite{Leach2001}. The interior of natural proteins is found to be occupied by the non-polar hydrophobic groups, which govern usually their structural stability. The surfaces, on the other hand, are covered by (charged) polar molecules, and play an important role in the formation/breaking of hydrogen bonding, a common process of solvent-solute interactions in hydrophobic effect. The hydrophobicity is also influenced by the variation in surrounding pressure - on increasing pressure water molecules are forced into the hydrophobic core and favor to denaturation \cite{Hummer1998}. Solvent induced interactions are also noted in wider physical processes like surfactant coagulation, complexation, detergency and the formation of gas clathrates~\cite{Sobolewski2007}. 
 
The effect of temperature has been noted in protein structures. The hidden nonpolar amino acids at the interior of proteins are exposed to water upon unfolding/denaturation due to rising temperature \cite{Dill1990}. The enthalpic and entropic parameters are the indicators of hydrophobic effect, and thus finally play a vital role for protein folding and denaturation.
Nearby room temperature, temperature effects are mainly driven by the entropic contributions~\cite{Privalov2001}. For folded amino acids in water, where protein residues are more ordered with less exposed surface area, the entropic change is negative and the structure is favorable comparing to the removal of those molecules from water~\cite{Hilderbrand1950}. Dispersion interactions and point charge electrostatics are also important to identify the structural stability of side chains in aminoacids, and the same help to determine the nature of folding \cite{Raschke2001}. As the simplest hydrocarbon, methane is considered to model organic molecules within the solvent environment, which is important in biochemical processes~\cite{Dang1994}.

\caption[Random compactness of the chain and the rearrangement to more stable configuration.]{Process I represents random compactness of the chain and the process II represents the rearrangement to more stable configuration, where the nonpolar groups move into the core \cite{Dill1990}.}
\label{folded-nonfolded}
\end{figure}

Solvent induced solute-solute interactions, where hydrophobicity is the primary concern, can be described in terms of changes in free energy as function of reaction co-ordinates (separation between the solute molecules). This is equivalent to the potential of mean force (PMF) in between solute particles in aqueous solution \cite{Hotta2005, Li2007}. PMF is generally characterized by the nature of contact minimum, desolvation barrier and solvent separated minimum which are controlled by the molecular size of solvent medium in addition to the inherent interactions in between the solute particles~\cite{Sobolewski2007, Leach2001}. Also the dynamics of the system due to modulating effect of solvents through collision and viscus drag force can be expressed in terms of PMF.
 
Experiments lack the microscopic details to study the atomistic level of interactions. For example: X-rays diffraction requires the crystal environment and can not observe the disordered conformations \cite{Hwang2011}. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can identify intermolecular interactions, however, lacks high resolution of molecular parameters, their dynamics and the process of governing protein structure. The details, on the other hand, can be achieved through computational simulations like molecular dynamics \cite{Allen1989}. Computer modeling can thus be a source of information for the prediction of ongoing process in any system which can be verified by the following experiments \cite{Raschke2001}. Furthermore, limitations of computer simulations have been updated in later modifications. Umbrella sampling simulation is a technique accommodated in GROMACS ({\it GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations}, a popular software for the method of molecular dynamics) which insists to visit every part of the energy landscape in PMF with the help of biasing potential, which is specially preferred for the rarely visited configurations in normal molecular dynamics~\cite{Kastner2011}.
We use this technique as an enhanced sampling approach to study methane-methane interactions in different solvent environments.

\section{Objectives of the study}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Present work aims to study the interactions of methane molecules within themselves and host materials in different environmental conditions. Methane in hydrates are important because of their dominant occupancy in nature. As a major component of natural gases, and less pollutant hydrocarbon than conventional sources like oil and gases, stability of methane in the conditions of natural occurrence is important. For the practical purpose
like for on-board applications, on the other hand, effective storage media are demanding. Since methane-methane interactions are affected by the environment where they sit on, similar to proteins in human body, the perturbation of liquid media on methane-methane interactions are to be understood. The main objectives of this thesis are summarized as follows.   

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item There are controversial reports regarding the stability of methane clathrates (CH$_4$-H$_2$O) compounds. Some of the reports show stable high 
pressure phases of methane hydrates like FIIhS (MH-III) and post-FIIhS structures, up to 86 GPa of pressure and 1000 K of temperature. However, a recent experiment indicates the decomposition of methane hydrate into its constituents above few GPa of pressure. One of the objectives of the present study is to estimate the stability of methane hydrates up to hundreds of GPa. The possibility of decomposition or/and transition of MH-III structure to high pressure structure is to be observed. 

\item Molecular distortions are difficult to see experimentally, because they involve hydrogen (H), which is a low X-ray scatterer. Hydrogen can 
only be seen with neutrons, but the sample size limitations do not allow to push neutron studies above 10-20 GPa. The structural features of methane hydrate are to be characterized up to high pressure (say few hundreds GPa of pressure) which is relevant to the geo-planetary regime, is another objective of the present work. It has been found that computational study have nicely estimated the structural and electronic properties of these systems at extreme conditions where as experiments have limitations due to high expenses and technological barrier. We purpose ab-initio calculations for the prediction of interesting (and so far unexplained) structural features of high-pressure properties of methane hydrates. Thermodynamic properties of methane hydrates with reference to its constituents will be considered as important indicators to study the structural preferences and possible changes in phase. The results from the computation are expected to be verified by experiments in near future with the development of new technologies. 

\item Besides the dominant presence of methane in nature, it is beneficial over the conventional petroleum oil and fossil fuels because of its higher energy density and less emission of carbon on burning. The conventional techniques of storing natural gases as well as other energy carrying gases need either very high pressure with very low temperature and are not efficient due to space, safety and economy related perspectives. Adsorption of methane on porous solid media like carbon nanomaterials are being heavily searched as alternatives since last few decades. Pure graphene and graphitic materials are unfit for the purpose of reversible storage of methane for practical applications due to their low temperature desorption properties. The recent scientific works, therefore, are trying to find different forms of carbon-metal combinations so that they show a good performance for storing methane at operating conditions. We use TM atoms (of 3d series in periodic table) to functionalize graphene and study their optimized geometries, electronic properties and charge redistribution to check their usefulness for adsorbing methane with appropriate strength. We aim to find the right proportion of methane on functionalized monolayer graphene for its
optimal storage. 

\item Methane-methane interactions in different liquid media can be a model research to understand the hydrophobic interaction in atomistic level.
Understanding of such interactions is important in biological processes including protein folding and its denaturation. Previous reports, based on MD simulations, have shown that the potential of mean force (PMF) between two methane molecules is characterized by the deeper contact minima (at around 4 angstrom) and shallower solvent separated minima (at around 7.3~angstrom). It has been reported that the solvent molecules, like water, induce dipoles around the surface of (hydrophobic) methane molecules, and the dipole-dipole interaction in combination with Lennard-Jones potential, creates an effective potential. This effective potential incorporates long-range interaction which is responsible for the solvent separated minima. Our aim is to probe the effect of different solvent environment like water, methanol and acetonitrile on methane-methane interaction as a function of distance. We use enhanced sampling simulations like umbrella sampling in GROMACS. The comparison of PMF between two methane molecules with the available results will check the reliability of our method. Similar calculations, in methanol and acetonitrile will show the effect of different liquid molecules on methane-methane interactions.
